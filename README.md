Right now I've just got a simple workflow pulling json files from the respective company's website and parsing them into plain text CIDR lists. Each file is only updated if the list actually changes.

Eventually I'll be adding in more lists and more sources to provide more thorough data for anyone to use as a sanity check, block list, or whatever.
